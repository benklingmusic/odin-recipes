        <h3>It isn't much but it's food</h3>
        <p>Look, we've all been there. You open the fridge and just stare into the void until the fridge beeps at you for leaving the door open for too long, breaking your trance and bringing you back to the land of the living. You need to eat. It's important. But everything requires work and you're <em>tired.</em> Whatever, just throw together what you can and call it a day. How bad could it be right? </p>
